    <h1>FOOD</h1>
    <h2>Shakam Ema Datshi</h2>
    <p>
        While you are in Bhutan, you will eat a whole lot of cheese and spice. 
        But if you want to cut up cheese from your diet, then this is probably
        the best food for you. Datshi is a Bhutan food that is made without cheese.
        Moreover, Datshi is also the first that you will learn in Dzongkha. Shakam 
        is dried beef in Bhutanese recipe. Beef is one of the most consumed meats 
        in Bhutan for its high protein value. The beef is dried and preserved which 
        gives it similar tastes like beef jerky. But, it is thicker than beef jerky 
        and is a traditional dish among Bhutan food.

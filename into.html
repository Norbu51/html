                        While you are in <span style="color: blue;">Bhutan</span>, you will eat a whole lot of cheese and spice. 
                        But <em> if you want to cut up  <br>cheese from your diet, then this is probably
                        the best food for you</em>. <strong> Datshi is a Bhutan food </strong> that is made with cheese
                        less than 10<sup>1/2</sup>kilogram and 10% of H<sub>2</sub>O.

                         Moreover, <code>Datshi is also <br>the first that you will learn in Dzongkha</code>. Shakam 
                        is dried beef in Bhutanese recipe. Beef is one of the most consumed meats 
                        in Bhutan for <u>its high protein value</u>. The beef is dried and preserved which 
                         gives it similar tastes like beef jerky. But, it is thicker than beef jerky 
                        and is a traditional dish among Bhutan food. even the <abbr title="World Helth Organization">WHO</abbr>
                        has mention that the diet which presents protient must be taken.
